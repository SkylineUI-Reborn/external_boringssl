      "message": "For a variety of messy reasons, this repository\u0027s structure is not quite the same as the upstream BoringSSL so, no, this should not be a merge commit.\n\nWe are most of the way through some changes in upstream OpenSSL that will make changing this viable, but it will also move a bunch of file paths and cause a bit of churn. Might be nice for this to happen someday, especially if it allows for more automated BoringSSL updates. but future work at best.",
