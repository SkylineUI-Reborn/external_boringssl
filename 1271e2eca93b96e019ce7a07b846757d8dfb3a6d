      "message": "This looks like it would give a big improvement in binary size across the Trusty TAs.  I\u0027m guessing it might also reduce performance a bit, but I\u0027m also guessing that the size improvement would out-weigh that.\n\nHowever, so far I\u0027ve only built with this, not tested in any way.   Is your team able to look into that?  (For example, this could potentially affect WV performance, which I know nothing about...)",

      "message": "I\u0027ve asked Sean ot run a full sweep of tests on devices, which should cover the function aspect.  I have a SW crypto test for BoringSSL I can run to verify numbers there.\nThere is also the long running Cts test that does lots of encryption via keymint, and we could check the durations of CtsKeystoreTestCases for any delta (hopefully those tests are too short to show anything, which is good).",
