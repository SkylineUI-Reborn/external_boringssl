The \"official\" fix for this issue was https://r.android.com/2333382 plus https://r.android.com/2333383 which probably should have been cherry-picked to older branches, but got overlooked.\n\nIt hasn\u0027t come up until now though, so I don\u0027t think anyone is running these native tests on older branches... They do get run as part of MTS on current branches though.\n\nWould you mind raising a bug on the Android issue tracker noting why you need these tests and I can use that to get the official fix cherry-picked.",
