      "message": "Thanks for this!  The \"official\" fix for this issue was https://r.android.com/2333382 plus https://r.android.com/2333383 which probably should have been cherry-picked to older branches, but got overlooked.\n\nIt hasn\u0027t come up until now though, so I don\u0027t think anyone is running these native tests on older branches... They do get run as part of MTS on current branches though.\n\nWould you mind raising a bug on the Android issue tracker noting why you need these tests and I can use that to get the official fix cherry-picked.",

This issue will cause test failures for boringssl, this is fatal error, and will result in reboot with reason \"boringssl-self-check-failed\". The official fixes for this issue have not been merged into the android-13.0.0_r61 branch, so this is a solution to this issue.",

      "message": "Thanks.\n\nJust FYI: `boringssl_self_test` and the test suites `boringssl_crypto_test` and `boringssl_ssl_test` are unrelated.\n\n`boringssl_self_test` is a runtime check that the hardware and software are working as expected.  It runs a number of FIPS-mandated self tests but not a complete suite of unit tests (which would be prohibitively expensive), i.e. it ensures that the software we ship is working as expected.\n\n`SSLTest` is part of `boringssl_ssl_test` which is a full suite of unit tests which are intended to be run *before* the software ships to ensure there are no bugs.\n\nBut yes, we should fix it... It\u0027s already fixed in Android 14 by the CLs I mentioned above.",
