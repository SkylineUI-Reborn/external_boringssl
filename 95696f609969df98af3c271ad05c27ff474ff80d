      "message": "Hehe, I have no idea how any of this works. Would you have the cycles to pick this up?\n\nThe last BoringSSL updated ended up taking a very long time because, a while back when I went to test Android\u0027s ability to handle test data, I thought I\u0027d tested things, but actually the tests weren\u0027t running at all. The goal is to get these tests running in *pre*submits for *this* repository. However, because of the broken SLO tooling in Android, they have to be added to a postsubmit first, otherwise the system doesn\u0027t even know the tests pass. (This is absurd, but OK.)",
