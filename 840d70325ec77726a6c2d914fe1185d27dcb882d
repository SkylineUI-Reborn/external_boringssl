      "message": "Updating boringssl in AOSP to pull in the API changes I made (and, including all the other changes since the last sync :) )\n\nNote: this is in a topic because it will also need a small change to `beto-rust` (for the boringssl use in `beto-rust` to still work). The `beto-rust` people are landing this change in their repo now and will launch an AOSP sync once it\u0027s merged, and add it to this topic.",
