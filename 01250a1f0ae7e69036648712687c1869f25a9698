      "message": "\u003e Seems harmless although how do we prevent non-test uses in dex2oat?\n\nI think the fact that ART isn\u0027t in `apex_available` effectively stops that. At least on device, and that\u0027s what matters. Clarified the comment.\n\n\u003e Also it seems a bit concerning that we can get version skew between these tests and libcrypto.\n\nI believe the only use is for SHA1 to [compute build IDs](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:art/dex2oat/linker/elf_writer_quick.cc;l\u003d306-318;drc\u003ddfc85005d93db3e7fe8daf4a45319dd727fb3c83), and it\u0027s somewhat unlikely the SHA1 algorithm will change.\n\nActually, I\u0027m hoping to do away with libcrypto.so entirely in the ART module just by linking SHA1 - and nothing else - statically. Beside the point here, but would that be a problem from a FIPS perspective?",
