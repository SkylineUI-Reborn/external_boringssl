Wasn\u0027t sure if this was mimicking the existing build (which has defaults because there are piles and piles of variants of libcrypto for some reason), or because there\u0027s some Android-level convention to split things this way.\n\n(I could imagine wanting to split it later, for the baremetal people. But then they\u0027d probably have different opinions on `visibility`, `host_supported`, `vendor_available`, and `product_available` anyway.)",
