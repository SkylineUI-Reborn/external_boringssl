      "message": "Regardless of the linkage type, apex_available is checked when a library becomes part of an APEX. \n\nSo, if you don\u0027t have \"//apex_available:anyapex\" and instead have \"com.android.conscrypt\", then only the APEX can have this library. And any attempt to use this library - either by statically link to it, or by dynamically link to it - in other APEX will be prohibited.\n\nHowever, doing that right now will break the build as this IS being used by several other APEXes. Please visit https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/build/soong/+/1252767/4/apex/apex.go for the actual lists.\n\nIf the current uses of this module is wrong, let me file a bug to separately address that.",
