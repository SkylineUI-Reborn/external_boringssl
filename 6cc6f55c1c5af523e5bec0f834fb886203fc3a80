Where will it be tested? Will issues be caught by presubmits? It seems bizarre to me that a setting on a Soong target would cause a CMake file to be used.\n\nWhat is binder_sdk? BoringSSL does not provide stability guarantees, so being part of an SDK also sounds problematic.",

In your case there\u0027s no need to test build of boringssl individually, because for boringssl cmake_snapshot_supported says \"I allow this target to be bundled with other CMake-based release archives\".\n\nThis flag doesn\u0027t say CMake would be used in Android build.\n\nbinder_sdk: it\u0027s a release of Binder to be used on non-Android Linux and built outside of Android build tree (with CMake). It\u0027s a name of soong target that creates a zip-ball to distribute.\n\nBoringSSL would not be a part of SDK surface - it\u0027s only here as internal dependency for Binder.",
