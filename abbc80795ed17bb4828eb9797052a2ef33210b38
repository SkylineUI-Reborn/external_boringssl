      "message": "I thought compiler-rt would be part of the Clang prebuilts, so should only change if we update Clang?  I believe it\u0027s a fairly stable library, mostly FP intrinsics plus a few random functions like this.\n\nI\u0027m still unsure if this is the correct solution.  It works around for the fact that for STL libs on Darwin we always add -nodefaultlibs to the command line but there may be a better way.  It may not even work if the -nodefaultlibs flag comes after this.\n\nI don\u0027t have a Darwin build environment, so haven\u0027t been able to experiment much.",
