      "message": "Not reviewed in details but it passes BoringSSL\u0027s submit queue so if it also passes our tests should be OK.\n\nKeeping Trusty in the loop (dsrbecky) as it appears not to build due to missing syscalls (sysctl, madvise).\n\nAlso adding enh as this includes https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/c/boringssl/+/42084 (BTI and Pauth support).  My understanding is that these should be no-ops on ARMv8 but maybe there are additional tests (or benchmarks?) we should run before submitting?  I\u0027d certainly run the Wycheproof suite to be on the safe side (might be a good opportunity to update it)\n\nWill upgrade my +1 once the others have had a chance to comment.",
